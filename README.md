# encrypton
A ransom-ware encyption test. Do not use! For education purposes only.

I am working on seeing how easy it is to create this popular hack. I am still just working on creating easy functions to encypt OS files.



## How to run:
Clone this repo
Change the directory.
Run the python files.
